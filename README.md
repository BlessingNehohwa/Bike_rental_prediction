## <b> Problem Statement </b>


The objective of this Case is to Predication of bike rental count on daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
       * Loading the dataset and libraries.
       * Data cleaning.
       * Typecasting the attributes
       * Missing value analysis.
       
    2. Attributes distributions and trends
       * Monthly distribution of counts
       * Yearly distribution of counts
       * Outliers analysis
       
    3. Normality test
    4. Correlation matrix 
    5. Split the dataset into train and test dataset
    6. Encoding the categorical features
    7. Modelling the training dataset
       * Linear Regression Model
       * Decision Tree Regressor Model
       * Random Forest Model
       
    8. Cross Validation Prediction
       * Linear Regression CV Prediction
       * Decision Tree Regressor CV Prediction
       * Random Forest CV Prediction
       
    9. Model performance on test dataset
       * Linear Regression Prediction
       * Decision Tree Regressor Prediction
       * Random Forest Prediction
       
    10. Model Evaluation Metrics
